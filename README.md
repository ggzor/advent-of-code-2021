## Remarks

- Scala solutions are **short** and **concise**, be sure to check them out.
- The solutions are self contained, they can easily be executed as shown in the
  next [section](#running-the-solutions). This also makes them just a bit cluttered
  because the parsing and the part selection are inside the same file.
- Both parts of each problem are solved in the same file, this requires a bit of
  generalization to solve both parts with almost the same code, and makes the
  code longer than other solutions.
- These are not the shortest or fastest solutions, but they are readable and
  show the key ideas for solving each problem and how to translate them to each
  different language.
- The Python solutions are a bit clunky because these are the ones I code first.
- The solutions in Rust are not so good because this is the first time I use
  Rust for this kind of problems. It gets better day by day, but don't expect amazing
  code.

## Running the solutions

The solutions are self-contained and should run easily using the appropriate
interpreter/compiler for each language, keeping the following considerations in
mind:

  - Input is taken from standard input.
  - Either `1` or `2` must be passed as arguments to choose which part to run.

### Scala 3

For example, to run the **Scala** solution for the **second part** of the
**first day**, you can use the following command:

```shell
cat day01/test01.txt | scala day01/Day01.scala 2
```

### Haskell

The solutions were tested with GHC `9.0.1`, but `8.x` should work too. 
No other libraries apart from `base`, `containers` and `mtl` are used, they
should be installed by default.

```shell
cat day01/test01.txt | runghc day01/Day01.hs 2
```

### Python

The solutions were tested with python `3.9`, but they should work using any version `>=3.8`.
Only `numpy` is used apart from the standard library.

```shell
cat day01/test01.txt | python3 day01/Day01.py 2
```

### Rust

To run a Rust solution you must compile it first and then run the resulting
executable:

```shell
rustc day01/Day01.rs
cat day01/test01.txt | ./Day01 2
```
